    "content": "My name is Jake, the guy behind The Instant Camera Guy. What began as a personal passion for these incredible cameras quickly evolved into an obsession: understanding how they work and, more importantly, how to fix them when they don't.\n\nToday, I operate as an ABN-registered sole trader specializing in the sales, servicing, restoration, and modification of classic Polaroid cameras.\n\n Polaroids are my main specialty, I also occasionally restore other film cameras, such as the Mamiya C series and Graflex Speed Graphics. My business is primarily focused on client repairs, so I don’t regularly sell refurbished cameras. However, I do find, restore, and sell them on occasion. Cameras for sale are typically listed on my Instagram page.\n\nI ship Australia-wide and am happy to ship pretty much anywhere overseas—just ask for a quote! All cameras I sell are guaranteed to work and come with a 6-month comprehensive warranty. I believe in preserving the magic of instant photography for generations to come."
